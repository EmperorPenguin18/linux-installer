# linux-installer
Universal GNU+Linux installer script

Support for Arch, Debian buster, Fedora 33, and Void included. Goal is to support as much hardware as possible. Made to work how I like things so if you want it to do something else fork away.

Features:

How to use:
1. Must be run from an Arch system (Live or no), with only one drive plugged in (other than install usb)
2. Make script executable (chmod +x) and run with ./install.sh
3. Answer prompts. Not designed to be user friendly, just covers the basics
4. Wait for installation to complete
5. Boot away! Only the most basic packages are installed so the rest is up to you. But thats the fun part right? :)
